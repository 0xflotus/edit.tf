This is a teletext editor implemented in JavaScript, so that people now 
need no more than a JavaScript-enabled browser in order to create their 
own teletext frames. It was written for the 
[teletext40](http://teletext40.com/100/1) project and
you can try the editor out at http://editor.teletext40.com/ - however,
it can also be used as a general-purpose editor.

Most of the functionality of the editor is accessed through keystrokes, 
shown in a table in the editor. Pressing escape takes you into command 
mode, in which the statusbar is coloured yellow, and then typing a 
(possibly shifted) letter will insert a control character or perform 
some other function.

Everything is in the HTML file. There are no external dependencies and 
no communication happens with any backend or 'cloud server'. Instead, 
the state of the frame is 'saved' into the URL. Therefore, to save your 
work, you can bookmark the URL in your browser. To share it, you can 
email the URL to others.

In the URL, the nybble before the colon describes the character set the 
page is encoded in (least significant three bytes) and whether the page 
is intended to be rendered with black foreground colours enabled (the 
most significant bit enabled if it is). The part of the URL after the
colon contains a base-64-encoded sequence of bits, amounting to 1120
base 64 digits. The encoding is standard 'base64url' with URL and Filename
Safe Alphabet (RFC 4648 ยง5 'Table 2: The "URL and Filename safe" Base 64
Alphabet'). After decoding, the seven-bit character code for column _c_
and row _r_ appears at bit positions _280r+7c_ to _280r+7c+6_, the most
significant bit appearing first.
