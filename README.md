# teletext-editor

This is a teletext editor implemented in JavaScript, so that people now 
need no more than a JavaScript-enabled browser in order to create their 
own teletext frames. It was written for the 
[teletext40](http://teletext40.com/100/1) project and you can try the 
editor out at http://editor.teletext40.com/ - however, it also works as 
a general-purpose editor, and is intended to be completely independent of
teletext40.

Most of the functionality of the editor is accessed through key 
sequences beginning with the escape key. They are summarised in a table 
to the right of the the editor. Pressing the escape key takes you into 
command mode, in which the status bar is coloured yellow, and then 
typing a (possibly shifted) letter will insert a control character or 
perform some other function.

Everything is supplied in a single HTML file. There are no external 
dependencies. You can email the HTML file to friends so that they can 
edit frames on their computer.

## All frame data is kept in the URL.

No communication happens with any backend or 'cloud server'. You don't 
need to be connected to the internet to use the editor. The editor 
doesn't save any data to the local disk either. Instead, the state of 
the frame is 'saved' into the URL. Therefore, to save your work, you can 
bookmark the URL in your browser. To share it, you can email the URL to 
others or post it on social networks. The server logs don't store this 
data, even when somebody clicks on a link containing it, so your frames 
are private.

In the URL, the nybble before the colon describes the character set the 
page is encoded in (the least significant three bytes) and whether the 
page is intended to be rendered with black foreground colours enabled 
(the most significant bit enabled if it is). The part of the URL after 
the colon contains a base-64-encoded sequence of bits, amounting to 1120 
base 64 digits. The encoding is standard 'base64url' with URL and 
Filename Safe Alphabet ([RFC 4648](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648) 
ยง5 'Table 2: The "URL and Filename safe" Base 64 Alphabet'). After 
decoding, the seven-bit character code for column _c_ and row _r_ 
appears at bit positions _280r+7c_ to _280r+7c+6_ inclusive, the most 
significant bit appearing first.

A script, `url2raw.pl`, in the `tools/` directory, is provided to assist 
with this conversion. Supply an editor URL on standard input and it will 
output the raw frame, with lines delimited with newlines, on standard 
output. Contributions of scripts to convert these URLs to formats 
required by other teletext systems would be very welcome.

## The editor is licenced under GPLv3.

The source code is commented throughout and licenced under the GNU 
General Public Licence v3.0, with additional requirements concerning 
minimisation of the source code. See the notice for more details.

Associated scripts and other tools are licenced under the same terms.

## Ways to contribute

Bug reports, enhancement requests and pull requests are welcome. If you 
would like to contribute but cannot program, documentation and tutorials 
would also be very welcome. If you're interested in contributing in this 
way, please comment on issue #3.

### As seen at...

The editor has been used for various events and systems:

* The editor was used by Dan Farrimond - @illarterate - and Carl Attrill at a
  workshop called *[Block Party](http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/performance-and-music/late-tate-june-2015)* 
  at the Tate Britain art gallery in June 2015.
  It was also used by Dan at *St. Helens Versus the Lizards* and continues to
  be used at other teletext events.
* The editor was used by the [CCC Video Operation Center](http://c3voc.de/) -
  @voc - as part of their DVB-T system. It broadcasted a signal containing 
  teletext to televisions belonging to the participants of the
  [Chaos Communication Camp 2015](https://events.ccc.de/camp/2015/wiki/Main_Page) in August 2015.

### Compatibility

* The Windows-based teletext editor [wxTED](http://teastop.co.uk/teletext/wxted/) by Peter Kwan - @peterkvt80 - has 
  implemented import from, and export to, the URLs used in this editor.
  Peter has also produced a Raspberry Pi teletext inserter!
